# Verilog Projects

The major projects which one should have a grip over while learning Verilog HDL, are compiled in this repository. All the projects are verified on Xilinx Vivado and EDAPlayground.
The projects mainly have a design file and a testbench file. Other basic codes are uploaded in a different repository: <Verilog Basic Designs>.
