Design and Verification of Synchronous and Asynchronous FIFO using Verilog

FIFO is a design component used for interfacing data transfer between two components either working on the same frequency or different frequencies. 
The design was implemented in such a way that there are no race and glitch conditions arise due to the design working in two different clock domains. 
I have implemented both Synchronous FIFO and Asynchronous FIFO using Verilog and RTL code and also verified the same using Verilog HDL.
