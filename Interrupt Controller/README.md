Design and Verification of Interrupt Controller

Interrupt Controller is a design used to collect interrupts from various peripheral controllers and forwards the interrupts to the processor on a priority basis. 
This continues till all the interrupts are serviced by the processor. 
It interfaces with the processor on one side using the APB interface and another side with a peripheral controller from which it gets the interrupts.
